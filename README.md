# Bias Balanced News

No news source is completely unbiased, and the difference in perspective has become more noticeable than ever. Front page headlines from one source may be nothing more than a footnote in another. With Bias Balanced, compare headlines from a wide array of news outlets in order to get a more complete picture of current events.
